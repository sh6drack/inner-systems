# Inner Systems/Contemplative AI — Shadrack Annor

## Purpose

Modern technology is designed to fragment as it emphasizes engagement over understanding.
This project explores what it would mean to reverse that — to build systems that support mindfulness, clarity, and self-inquiry. I aim to establish programs that wholeheartedly respect the mind, body, and soul.

## Areas of Focus

- **Contemplative Interfaces**  
  Interfaces that don't hijack dopamine — they ask better questions, don’t rush to answers.

- **Responsible AI**  
  Centering bias, explainability, and consent — not as PR moves, but as prerequisites for trust.

- **Digital Well-being by Design**  
  Shifting from extraction to restoration. Attention is sacred — most platforms treat it like oil.

## Current Projects

- **Contemplative Chat Prototype**  
  A minimalist chatbot trained on context based prompts, self-reflection, and zero bias. Avoids feeding into dopaminergic reward loops.

- **Design Brief: "A Non-Dual Operating System"**  
  A speculative doc exploring what computing would look like if it didn’t assume a split between user and system.
