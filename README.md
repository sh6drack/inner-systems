# Contemplative AI — Shadrack Annor

**A working lab and philosophical outline toward building AI systems that reduce ego, restore attention, and support deep reflection.**

---

## Purpose

Modern technology is designed to fragment. It maximizes engagement, not understanding.  
This project explores what it would mean to reverse that — to build systems that support slowness, clarity, and self-inquiry.

---

## Areas of Focus

- **Contemplative Interfaces**  
  Interfaces that don't hijack dopamine — they ask better questions, don’t rush to answers.

- **Responsible AI**  
  Centering bias, explainability, and consent — not as PR moves, but as prerequisites for trust.

- **Digital Well-being by Design**  
  Shifting from extraction to restoration. Attention is sacred — most platforms treat it like oil.

---

## Current Projects

- **Contemplative Chat Prototype**  
  A minimalist chatbot trained on Zen prompts, self-reflection structures, and poetic recursion. No validation loops. No gamification.

- **Design Brief: "A Non-Dual Operating System"**  
  A speculative doc exploring what computing would look like if it didn’t assume a split between user and system.

- **Research Archive**  
  - Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff)  
  - Psychedelic Integration + Risk Literature (Palitsky et al., Aday et al., McNamee)  
  - Attention Restoration Theory (Kaplan)

## Guiding Questions

- Can artificial systems prompt genuine inner silence?
- What is the minimum viable interface for transformation?
- How do you build with care, not just code?

## Long-Term Vision

To create a toolkit — philosophical, technical, and design-oriented — for engineers and product thinkers who want to build technology that respects the mind, body, and soul.
